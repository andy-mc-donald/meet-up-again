## General info
Where's a convenient place to meet? Enter two postcodes and choose your type of venue to get a tailored list of suggestions. 

The App developed by [Francesca](https://github.com/frannyfra), [Leonie](https://github.com/LaLeonie) and [Andy](https://github.com/andy-mc-donald). 

A previous version of this app was developed by our Founders and Coders cohort using a different tech stack. We wanted to rebuild the project using React and Material UI.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) 
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
- [Geolib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/geolib) 
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- JavaScript 
- HTML 

- APIs: 
    - [Postcodes.io](https://postcodes.io/)
Postcodes.io is an open sourced project maintained by Ideal Postcodes. It is a free resource, allowing developers to search, reverse geocode and extract UK postcode and associated data.

    - [Four Square Places API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/places-api/) 
The Places API offers real-time access to Foursquareâ€™s global database of rich venue data and user content to power your location-based experiences in your app or website.
    
*This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.*
